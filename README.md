# Feedreader

## Introduction
In this project, I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The goal of this project was to build a test suite for the application. The goal of this test suite was to learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application.

## How to Run
Unzip the uploaded file labeled “feedreader”. You can view the webpage two ways. The first way is to right click on the index.html file and open in your browser( Safari, Google Chrome, etc). The second way is to open the index.html file in your Text Editor such as Atom or Sublime. You can then run the index.html file and it’ll open in your browser.
